# Notes Template

A personal template I have created for my own use.

A lot of the code is from the following sources:
1. https://github.com/tecosaur/BMC
2. https://github.com/lambdasolver/LaTeX
3. https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/master/latex_template


## To use:
#### Without Intellij Idea : -
1. Copy this directory to the same directory as your LaTeX file.

   ```bash
   $ cp ./letterfonts.tex ./macros.tex ./preamble.tex ./main.tex [some_dir]
   ```

2. Edit the file "main.tex" to your liking.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">OR</h3>

#### Using Intellij Idea as your editor (Method I use) : -
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone rohit746/Notes-Template [some_dir]
   ```
2. Open it in intellij idea.
3. Install the [TeXiFy-Idea](https://github.com/Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA) extension.

Now you can compile the Main.tex file.
You can also set compile options refer this video : -

!!!! note

    I expect you to be able to install common LaTeX packages like amsmath, amsfonts, and amssymb.
